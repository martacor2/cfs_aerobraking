# Closed-form solution for shallow, high-altitude, atmospheric flight

- To run all simulations at once and obtain results, run `all_sims.py`
- To run a single simulation and obtain results, run `main2_0.py`
- `closed_form_solution.py` contains helper functions to compute the current closed form solution
- `data_analysis.py` contains parsing functions for the drag passage results in the `DragPassageResults` folder
- `lamberts_problem.py` contains helper functions to solve Lambert's problem in different ways
- the `old_code` folder should not be necessary
